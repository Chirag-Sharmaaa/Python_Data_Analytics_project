# Data Preparation and Cleanup
--- 
This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.  

## Import & Clean Up Data
I start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality
```python
# Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```
## Filter US Jobs 
To focus my analysis on the U.S. job market, I apply filters to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in the United States.
```python
df_US = df[df['job_country'] == 'United States']
```

# The Analysis
---

Each Jupyter notebook for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data job market. Here’s how I approached each question:

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to depending on the role I'm targeting.

### Visualize Data 

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)


for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)[::-1]
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skill_percent', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_count', palette='dark:b_r')

plt.show()
```

### Results:

- Both Python and Tableau show relatively stable demand throughout the year with some fluctuations but remain essential skills for data analysts. Power BI, while less demanded compared to the others, shows a slight upward trend towards the year's end.


## 3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?

To identify the highest-paying roles and skills, I only got jobs in the United States and looked at their median salary. But first I looked at the salary distributions of common data jobs like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst, to get an idea of which jobs are paid the most.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [3_Salary_Analysis](3_Salary_Analysis.ipynb)

### Visualize Data:

```python
sns.boxplot(data=df_US_top6, x='salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short', order=job_order)

ticks_x = plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K')
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(ticks_x)
plt.show()
``` 

### Results:
![box_plot](Images/Salary_analysis_box_plot.png)

Box plot visualizing the salary distributions for the top 6 data job titles.

### Insights:
- There's a significant variation in salary ranges across different job titles. Senior Data Scientist positions tend to have the highest salary potential, with up to $600K, indicating the high value placed on advanced data skills and experience in the industry.

- Senior Data Engineer and Senior Data Scientist roles show a considerable number of outliers on the higher end of the salary spectrum, suggesting that exceptional skills or circumstances can lead to high pay in these roles. In contrast, Data Analyst roles demonstrate more consistency in salary, with fewer outliers.

- The median salaries increase with the seniority and specialization of the roles. Senior roles (Senior Data Scientist, Senior Data Engineer) not only have higher median salaries but also larger differences in typical salaries, reflecting greater variance in compensation as responsibilities increase.

### Highest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data Analysts

Next, I narrowed my analysis and focused only on data analyst roles. I looked at the highest-paid skills and the most in-demand skills. I used two bar charts to showcase these.

### Visualize Data:
```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1)  

# Top 10 Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_top_pay, x='median', y=df_DA_top_pay.index, hue='median', ax=ax[0], palette='dark:b_r')

# Top 10 Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analystsr')
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_skills, x='median', y=df_DA_skills.index, hue='median', ax=ax[1], palette='light:b')

plt.show()
```

### Results:
Here's the breakdown of the highest-paid & most in-demand skills for data analysts in the US:

![horizontal_bars](Images/horizontal_bar_plots.png)

### Insights:
- The top graph shows specialized technical skills like dplyr, Bitbucket, and Gitlab are associated with higher salaries, some reaching up to $200K, suggesting that advanced technical proficiency can increase earning potential.

- The bottom graph highlights that foundational skills like Excel, PowerPoint, and SQL are the most in-demand, even though they may not offer the highest salaries. This demonstrates the importance of these core skills for employability in data analysis roles.

- There's a clear distinction between the skills that are highest paid and those that are most in-demand. Data analysts aiming to maximize their career potential should consider developing a diverse skill set that includes both high-paying specialized skills and widely demanded foundational skills.


## 4. What are the most optimal skills to learn for Data Analysts?

To identify the most optimal skills to learn ( the ones that are the highest paid and highest in demand) I calculated the percent of skill demand and the median salary of these skills. To easily identify which are the most optimal skills to learn.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [4_Optimal_Skills](4_Optimal_Skills.ipynb)

### Visualize:
```python
from adjustText import adjust_text
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(df_DA_skills_high_demand['skill_percent'], df_DA_skills_high_demand['median_salary'])
plt.show()
```

### Results:
A scatter plot visualizing the most optimal skills (high paying & high demand) for data analysts in the US.

![scatter_plot_1](Images/scatter_plot_1.png)

### Insights:
- The skill Oracle appears to have the highest median salary of nearly $97K, despite being less common in job postings. This suggests a high value placed on specialized database skills within the data analyst profession.
